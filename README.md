# ThreatWraith
ThreatWraith is a modular red team simulator designed to generate realistic attack behavior for blue team detection training. Inspired by frameworks like Atomic Red Team and Darktrace, ThreatWraith lets you execute scenario playbooks that simulate real-world intrusions across multiple MITRE ATT&amp;CK stages.
